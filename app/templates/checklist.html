					The Why Cat Checklist helps you hone your critical analysis skills.
					It shows you what to look for - the signposts of well-researched, 
					balanced and unbiased health information. So you know which websites 
					you can trust.</p>
					<p>
					Here's how it works. Copy and paste the URL of the website you've found
					into the box below. Then click Start. We'll show you a question about the
					website, which you answer. You can easily look at the website to answer the
					question, because it's right there, on the same page. There's hints and 
					examples for each question.
